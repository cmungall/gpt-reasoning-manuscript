### Semi-automatic generation of reasoning benchmarks from ontologies

We created a methods to generate 6 classes of benchmarks

|code|task|description|
|---|---|---|
|sat|OntologyCoherencyTask|A task to determine if an ontology is coherent.      There should be a single answer, which is a boolean.|
|indirect|EntailedIndirectSuperClassTask|A task to determine the indirect superclasses of a class.|
|superc|EntailedTransitiveSuperClassTask|A task to determine the all transitive superclasses of a class.|
|expr|EntailedSubClassOfExpressionTask|A task to determine the subclasses of a class expression.|
|dir-sup|EntailedDirectSuperClassTask|A task to determine the direct superclasses of a class.      Includes those entailed by other axioms, e.g. equivalence axioms.      Context: a standard pattern in bio-ontologies is to infer the structure     of one ontology from another - e.g. the metabolic process branch in GO     may be entailed by GO equivalence axioms plus the IS_A links in CHEBI.|
|mrca|MostRecentCommonSubsumerTask|A task to determine the most specific common ancestors.|
|abox|ABoxTask|A task to infer assertions over property chains and transitvity in aboxes.|

### GPT-based reasoning agent

We created a GPT-based reasoning agent that is intended to perform ontological reason using
a few-shot learning approach, using instruction prompting and in-context examples.

The reasoning agent is implemented as part of the OntoGPT system.

3 methods for performing reasoning were implemented:

- direct
- post-hoc explanation-based
- chain-of-thought reasoning

#### Direct reasoning
